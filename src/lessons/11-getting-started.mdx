## Goal of this lab \{.no-step\}

In this lab, you will make sure your environment is ready and make your **first contribution** to the course repository.

Nothing here can break your system.  
Nothing here is graded for correctness.  
The goal is simply to get started and feel comfortable.

By the end of this lab, you will have:
- cloned the course repository
- verified that required tools work
- created and committed your first file

All hands-on work in this course happens in the course repository.

If something does not work, raise your hand early. That is expected.

## Verify required tools

Run the following commands in a terminal:

```bash
git --version
docker --version
```

If both commands print a version number, you are good.

If Docker is available, you can optionally run:

```bash
docker run hello-world
```

This step is only to verify that things work.  
If something fails, stop here and ask for help.

## Clone the course repository

Clone the course repository to your machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/codyzu/res507-2025-2026-work.git
cd res507-2025-2026-work
```

Once cloned:
- open the folder in your editor
- take a moment to look around

You should see folders like:
- `labs/`
- `app/` (or similar)
- `README.md`

You do not need to understand everything yet.

## Create your first file

Inside the repository, create the following file:

```txt showLineNumbers=false
labs/11-welcome/hello.txt
```

Add the following content:

```txt showLineNumbers=false
Hello from <your first name>
```

That is all. Keep it simple.

This file exists only to give you something safe to commit.

## Check Git status

Before committing, check what Git sees:

```bash
git status
```

You should see your new file listed as untracked.

This command is important. You will use it a lot.

## Commit your change

Add and commit the file:

```bash
git add labs/11-welcome/hello.txt
git commit -m "Add hello file"
```

Then check the history:

```bash
git log --oneline
```

You should see your commit.

Congratulations. You have made your first commit in this course.

## Bonus

If you finish early, you can optionally:
- add a second line to `hello.txt`
- or create a small `README.md` inside `labs/11-welcome/`

This is optional and not required.

## What matters in this lab \{.no-step\}

What matters:
- you cloned the repo
- you ran a few commands
- you committed something

What does not matter:
- the content of the file
- speed
- prior experience

This lab is about **confidence and setup**, not technical depth.

## Before moving on \{.no-step\}

Make sure:
- you are comfortable running commands
- you know where the course repository is
- you know how to make and commit changes

We will build on this repository in every future lab.
