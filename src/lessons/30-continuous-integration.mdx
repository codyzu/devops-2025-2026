## Introduction \{.no-step\}

In this lab, you will create a minimal Continuous Integration (CI) job and watch it run automatically after you push a commit.

This lab is designed as a preview. If you run out of time, stop at any point. We will cover CI in depth in the next session.

## Prerequisites \{.no-step\}

You should have:
- the course lab repository cloned locally
- Git working on your machine
- a GitHub account and access to a repository you can push to

## Repository setup \{.no-step\}

For this lab, you must work in **your own copy** of the repository on GitHub.

- Create a **fork** of the instructor repository under your GitHub account: https://github.com/codyzu/res507-2025-2026-work.
- Clone your fork locally.
- Push all changes to **your fork**, not to the instructor repository.

You need a **GitHub account** to complete this lab.  
If you do not already have one, create it before continuing.

During this lab, you will create new files and directories yourself.  
For example, the `scripts/` directory does not exist initially and will be created as part of the exercises.

## Create a CI preview branch

Create a new branch for this lab:

```bash
git switch -c feature/ci-preview
```

Confirm your status:

```bash
git status
```

## Add a script that CI can run

Create a new script file:

```bash
mkdir -p scripts
```

Create `scripts/ci-preview.sh` with the following content:

```bash
#!/usr/bin/env bash
set -euo pipefail

echo "CI preview: hello from $(uname -s)"
echo "Current directory:"
pwd

echo "Repository status:"
git status

echo "Done."
```

Make the script executable:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/ci-preview.sh
```

Run it locally to confirm it works:

```bash
./scripts/ci-preview.sh
```

## Add a minimal CI configuration

Add a minimal GitHub Actions workflow that runs after every push.

### GitHub Actions workflow

Create the workflow directory:

```bash
mkdir -p .github/workflows
```

Create `.github/workflows/ci.yml`:

```yaml
name: CI Preview

on:
  push:

jobs:
  preview:
    runs-on: ubuntu-latest
    steps:
      - name: Checkout
        uses: actions/checkout@v4

      - name: Run preview script
        run: ./scripts/ci-preview.sh
```

## Commit and push

Stage your changes:

```bash
git add scripts .github/workflows/ci.yml
```

Commit:

```bash
git commit -m "Add CI preview job"
```

Push your branch to your remote:

```bash
git push -u origin feature/ci-preview
```

## Observe the CI run

Open your repository on GitHub and go to the **Actions** tab.

You should see a workflow run named **CI Preview** for your branch.

Open the job logs and confirm you can find these lines:
- `CI preview: hello from`
- `Repository status:`
- `Done.`

## Troubleshooting \{.no-step\}

### CI cannot find the script

Confirm the script exists and is executable:

```bash
ls -la scripts
```

### Permission denied when running the script

Re-apply executable permissions and commit the change:

```bash
chmod +x scripts/ci-preview.sh
git add scripts/ci-preview.sh
git commit -m "Make CI preview script executable"
git push
```

### No CI run appears after pushing

Confirm you pushed to the correct remote and branch:

```bash
git remote -v
git branch --show-current
```

If you are using GitHub Actions, confirm the workflow file exists:

```bash
ls -la .github/workflows
```

## Wrap-up \{.no-step\}

You have created a minimal CI job that runs automatically after a push.

In the next session, you will expand this into a real pipeline with checks like formatting, linting, and tests.
