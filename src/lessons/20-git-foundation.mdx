## Introduction \{.no-step\}

In this module, we focus on Git as the foundation of all DevOps workflows.

Before automation, pipelines, containers, or deployment, there is always version control.  
Git is the system that turns individual changes into a reliable, automatable process.

The goal here is not to memorize commands, but to become comfortable **making, undoing, and combining changes**.

## What you will do \{.no-step\}

During this module, you will:  
- work on a single repository  
- create and merge branches  
- resolve a merge conflict  
- understand why Git enables automation  

This module is mostly hands-on.

## Understanding the repository state

Before making changes, check the current state of the repository.

Run:

```bash
git status
```

Observe:  
- which branch you are on  
- whether your working tree is clean  

Then run:

```bash
git log --oneline --decorate
```

This shows the commit history and branch pointers.

Do not try to memorize this output.  
The goal is simply to recognize it.

## Creating a feature branch

Create a new branch for your work:

```bash
git switch -c feature/git-practice
```

Confirm that you are on the new branch:

```bash
git status
```

Branches allow you to work without affecting the main branch.

## Making and committing a change

Create a new file:

```text
labs/20-git-foundation/notes.txt
```

Add a few lines of text. The content does not matter.

Check the status, then commit:

```bash
git add labs/20-git-foundation/notes.txt
git commit -m "Add notes for Git practice"
```

You have now created a commit on your branch.

## Switching branches and observing changes

Switch back to the main branch:

```bash
git switch main
```

Observe that your new file is no longer present.

Switch back to your branch:

```bash
git switch feature/git-practice
```

The file reappears.

This demonstrates a core Git concept:  
branches are pointers to different states of the repository.

## Merging the branch into main

### Switch to main:

```bash
git switch main
```

### Merge your feature branch:

```bash
git merge feature/git-practice
```

If no conflict occurs, the merge completes immediately.

Check the history again:

```bash
git log --oneline --decorate
```

Notice how the branch history is combined.

## Creating a merge conflict (guided)

Merge conflicts are normal and expected.  
We will create one intentionally.

### On the main branch:

- Open the file `workspace/story.txt`.  
- Modify a single line.  
- Save the file.

Commit the change:

```bash
git add workspace/story.txt
git commit -m "Modify file on main"
```

### Switch to your feature branch:

```bash
git switch feature/git-practice
```

Modify the same line in a different way.  
Commit the change:

```bash
git add workspace/story.txt
git commit -m "Modify file on feature branch"
```

### Switch back to main and attempt the merge:

```bash
git switch main
git merge feature/git-practice
```

Git will report a conflict.

## Resolving the merge conflict

Open the conflicted file in your editor.

You will see conflict markers showing two versions of the content.

Decide what the final version should be.  
Remove the conflict markers.  
Save the file.

Complete the merge:

```bash
git add workspace/story.txt
git commit -m "Resolve merge conflict"
```

You have now resolved a merge conflict successfully.

## Why Git enables DevOps

At this point, you have:  
- isolated work in a branch  
- created commits  
- merged changes  
- resolved a conflict explicitly

Automation systems rely on exactly these events:  
- commits  
- branches  
- merges

Git is what makes Continuous Integration (CI) and Continuous Delivery (CD) possible.

## Assessment: Git checkpoint \{.no-step\}

Before moving on, perform a short Git checkpoint.

You should be able to:  
- create a branch  
- commit a change  
- merge a branch  
- resolve a merge conflict  
- explain what you did

This checkpoint is:  
- practical  
- low stress  
- low weight in the final grade

It may be evaluated by reviewing your repository or through a short explanation.

## Optional extensions (if time allows) \{.no-step\}

If you finish early, you can optionally:  
- repeat the conflict exercise with a different file  
- explore `git diff`  
- explore `git log --graph`

These are not required.

## Conclusion \{.no-step\}

Git is the backbone of DevOps because it turns individual work into a reliable, shared history.

In the next module, we will start automating what happens **after a commit**.  
That is where Continuous Integration begins.
